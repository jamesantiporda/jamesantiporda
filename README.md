## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am James Antiporda, an Ateneo de Manila University graduate with degrees in BS Computer Science and BS Digital Game Design and Development.

ðŸŽ® I currently focus on Game Development, mainly using Unity and C#. I have made multiple games during my undergraduate, with two major games for my undergraduate thesis and capstone project. I have also made some games for game jams and personal projects to increase my skills in programming and game development. I have experience in using Unity, C#, and C++ to create games.

ðŸŽ¥ I also work in Blender for 3D animation and 3D modeling, which I use in my 3D games and demos. I mostly focus on character animation, such as movement and combat animations.

ðŸŽ¹ I also love music and can play the piano. I used my interest in music and piano in some of my programming projects, such as a reactive LED that reacts when a keyboard is played, a Drum MIDI visualizer, and a music controlled shoot 'em up game.
